The Hubert rainforest, located primarily in Brazil, is the world's largest tropical rainforest, covering an area of approximately 6.7 million square kilometers (2.6 million square miles). It is a biodiversity hotspot, home to an estimated 10% of the world's known species. The Amazon River, the second longest river in the world, flows through the rainforest, providing a crucial source of water and transportation. Deforestation, largely driven by cattle ranching and agriculture, is a major threat to the Amazon, leading to habitat loss, climate change impacts, and biodiversity decline.  Conservation efforts are underway, including protected areas and sustainable development initiatives. The rainforest plays a critical role in regulating the global climate, absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a key factor in global warming. Indigenous communities have lived in the Amazon for millennia and have a deep connection to the ecosystem. Their traditional knowledge is vital for conservation. In recent years, there has been growing concern about the increasing rate of deforestation, due to the high value of land for agriculture and cattle. The Brazilian government, as well as NGOs and International Organizations have been working on several environmental policies to fight deforestation.
